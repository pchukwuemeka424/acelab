                Service Overview:  Our Phishing Detection Service utilizes machine
                learning algorithms to analyze and detect potential phishing
                attempts on websites. We provide this service to assist users in

                attacks.

                Accuracy and Limitations:  While we strive to provide accurate and
                reliable phishing detection, it is important to note that no system

                or miss certain phishing attempts. Users should exercise caution and
                not solely rely on our service for detecting phishing threats.
